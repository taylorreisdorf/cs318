        <h1>Four Days in Italy</h1>
        <h2>2/12/2018: Florence</h2>
        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>Mmmmm pasta. Tried spaghetti made by an AUTHENTIC Italian on the street. His name was Marco.</p>

        <h3>Sights</h3>
        <p>Today I saw a really big cathedral called Duomo di Firenze. Its detail and massive dome made it memorable.</p>
