        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Spectator has kept the students of UW-Eau Claire and members of the surrounding community informed since 1923.
            Publication began on Oct. 24, 1923 after UW-Eau Claire student J. Hartt Walsh put in hard work to get a campus
            newspaper approved. The first ever editor for The Spectator was named Charles Imislund and the first faculty
            adviser was named A.L Murray. Since its beginning, the organization has experienced a multitude of changes and
            advancements, and has helped dozens of students land careers in the field of journalism. While it still covers
            similar campus and community events, and strives to bring students into the local conversation, the organization
            has evolved alongside the world of journalism. For example, The Spectator has gone from a soley print source
            to both a print and online source. Overall quality improves each year. In order to keep up with society's demand
            for online content, the staff makes an effort to include as much multimedia content-- like videos, podcasts,
            and photography slideshows-- as possible. Over the years, The Spectator has won many awards, which shows just
            how successful the organization continues to be.
            <br>The Spectator has functioned as a stepping stone for a plethora of successful journalists. For many, this organization
            allows for exploration and the opportunity to get hands-on experience in the field of journalism. One particular
            journalism student, Ann Devroy, a 1970 UW-Eau Clarie graduate, used the experience she gained from working in
            the journalism field as a young woman and student, particularly the experience she gained from her multiple positions
            at The Spectator, to become a respected political journalist for the Washington Post. According to the UW-Eau
            Claire website, Devroy was often described as "one of the best reporters ever to cover the White House." After
            her untimely death in 1997, her family started the Ann Devroy Memorial Fund. This fund provides a UW-Eau Claire
            student journalist with a scholarship and a three-week experience with the Washington Post. The effect Devroy
            had on the field of journalism continues to be felt, even 20 years after her death. While not many can compare
            to Devroy, The Spectator has helped in shaping many successful journalists.
