        <h2>All About The Spectator</h2>
        <p> The Spectator is UW-Eau Claire's primary print news source. It has played a major role on the UW-Eau Claire campus
            since 1923. The dedicated staff strives to inform the campus community in an unbiased, interesting, and truthful
            manner. Under the supervision of faculty adviser Jan Larson, the staff aims to create consistently high-quality
            content that adheres to the Associated Press (AP) Style. The all-student staff of around 30 people is made up
            of a handful of Staff Writers, two Copy Editors, a Chief Copy Editor, a Multimedia Editor, an Opinion/Editorial
            Editor, a Currents Editor, two Sports Editors, a News Editor, a Managing Editor, and an Editor in Chief. The
            Spectator takes pride in being run by mostly women. Pictured below is the female editorial staff (minus the Multidmedia
            Editor). While the staff no longer recieives monetary compensation, the experience and knowledge attained from
            working for the newspaper is priceless.

            <br> Each Thursday, the staff meets in The Spectator office (which is located in Hibbard Hall on campus) for a weekly
            budget. Here, any problems that were noticed during the week are addressed, editors describe the kinds of stories
            they need covered for their section, and stories for the next deadline are assigned. While print issues are distributed
            every other week, there is constantly content being posted online. In order to reach as many people as possible,
            The Spectator issues are distributed all over campus. There are The Spectator newsstands in almost every building
            on campus. Additonally, some local businesses, like Racy D'Lene's Coffee Lounge on Water Street, have a few copies
            of The Spectator available for customers to view.
