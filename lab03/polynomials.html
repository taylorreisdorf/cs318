    <h1>Polynomials</h1>
    <p>If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. 
        Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders.</p>
    <p>Constant</p>
    <blockquote>Constant polynomials have the form <code>a.</code></blockquote>
    <p>Linear</p>
    <blockquote>Linear polynomials have the form <code>a &times; x + b.</code> </blockquote>
    <p>Quadratic</p>
    <blockquote>Quadratic polynomials have the form <code>a &times; x<sup>2</sup> + b &times; x + c.</code></blockquote>
    <p>Cubic</p>
    <blockquote>Cubic polynomials have the form <code>a &times; x<sup>3</sup> + b &times; x<sup>2</sup> + c &times; x + d.</code></blockquote>
